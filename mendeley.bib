abstract = {A learning attractor neural network (LANN) with a double dynamics of neural activities and synaptic efficacies, operating on two different timescales is studied by simulations in preparation for an electronic implementation, The present network includes several quasi-realistic features: neurons are represented by their afferent currents and output spike rates; excitatory and inhibitory neurons are separated; attractor spike rates as well as coding levels in arriving stimuli are low; learning takes place only between excitatory units. Synaptic dynamics is an unsupervised, analogue Hebbian process, but long term memory in the absence of neural activity is maintained by a refresh mechanism which on long timescales discretizes the synaptic values, converting learning into asynchronous stochastic process induced by the stimuli on the synaptic efficacies. This network is intended to lean a set of amactors from the statistics of freely arriving stimuli, which are represented by extemal synaptic inputs injected into the excitatory neurons. In the simulations different types of sequences of many thousands of stimuli are presented to Ihe network, without distinguishing in the dynamics a leaming phase from retrieval. Stimulus sequences differ in pre-assigned global statistics (including time-dependent statistics); in orders of presentation of individual stimuli within a given statistics: in lengths of time intervals for each presentation and in the intervals separating one stimulus from another. We find that the network effectively learns a set of attractors representing the statistics of the stimuli. and is able to modify its amactors when the input staristics change. Moreover, as the global input statistics changes the network can also forget attracton related to stimulus classes no longer presented. Forgetting takes place only due to the arrival of new stimuli. The performance of the network and the statistics of he amactors are studied as a function of the inmt statistics. Mast of the large-scale characteristics of the leamina dynamics can be captured theoretically. This model modifies a previous implementation of a LANN composed of discrete neurons. in a nerwork of more redistic neurons. The different elements have been designed to facilitate their implementation in silicon.â€ On leave of absence from Racah Institute of Physics, Jerusalem, Israel.

@article{Antolik2011,
abstract = {Hubel \&amp; Wiesel classified primary visual cortex (V1) neurons as either simple, with responses modulated by the spatial phase of a sine grating, or complex, i.e. largely phase invariant. Much progress has been made in understanding how simple cells develop, and there are now detailed computational models establishing how they can form topographic maps ordered by orientation preference. There are also models of how complex cells can develop using outputs from simple cells with different phase preferences, but no model of how a topographic orientation map of complex cells could be formed based on the actual connectivity patterns found in V1. Addressing this question is important, because the majority of existing developmental models of simple-cell maps group neurons selective to similar spatial phases together, which is contrary to experimental evidence, and makes it difficult to construct complex cells. Overcoming this limitation is not trivial, because mechanisms responsible for map development drive receptive fields of nearby neurons to be highly correlated, while co-oriented receptive fields of opposite phases are anti-correlated. In this work, we model V1 as two topographically organised sheets representing cortical layer 4 and 2/3. Only layer 4 receives direct thalamic input. Both sheets are connected with narrow feed-forward and feedback connectivity. Only layer 2/3 contains strong long-range lateral connectivity, in line with current anatomical findings. Initially all weights in the model are random, and each is modified via a Hebbian learning rule. The model develops smooth, matching, orientation preference maps in both sheets. Layer 4 units become simple cells, with phase preference arranged randomly, while those in layer 2/3 are primarily complex cells. To our knowledge this model is the first explaining how simple cells can develop with random phase preference, and how maps of complex cells can develop, using only realistic patterns of connectivity.},

@article{Ben-Yishai1995,
abstract = {The role of intrinsic cortical connections in processing sensory input and in generating behavioral output is poorly understood. We have examined this issue in the context of the tuning of neuronal responses in cortex to the orientation of a visual stimulus. We analytically study a simple network model that incorporates both orientation-selective input from the lateral geniculate nucleus and orientation-specific cortical interactions. Depending on the model parameters, the network exhibits orientation selectivity that originates from within the cortex, by a symmetry-breaking mechanism. In this case, the width of the orientation tuning can be sharp even if the lateral geniculate nucleus inputs are only weakly anisotropic. By using our model, several experimental consequences of this cortical mechanism of orientation tuning are derived. The tuning width is relatively independent of the contrast and angular anisotropy of the visual stimulus. The transient population response to changing of the stimulus orientation exhibits a slow "virtual rotation." Neuronal cross-correlations exhibit long time tails, the sign of which depends on the preferred orientations of the cells and the stimulus orientation.},

abstract = {During working memory tasks, the firing rates of single neurons recorded in behaving monkeys remain elevated without external cues. Modeling studies have explored different mechanisms that could underlie this selective persistent activity, including recurrent excitation within cell assemblies, synfire chains and single-cell bistability. The models show how sustained activity can be stable in the presence of noise and distractors, how different synaptic and voltage-gated conductances contribute to persistent activity, how neuromodulation could influence its robustness, how completely novel items could be maintained, and how continuous attractor states might be achieved. More work is needed to address the full repertoire of neural dynamics observed during working memory tasks.},

@article{Somers1995,
abstract = {It is well known that visual cortical neurons respond vigorously to a limited range of stimulus orientations, while their primary afferent inputs, neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), respond well to all orientations. Mechanisms based on intracortical inhibition and/or converging thalamocortical afferents have previously been suggested to underlie the generation of cortical orientation selectivity; however, these models conflict with experimental data. Here, a 1:4 scale model of a 1700 microns by 200 microms region of layer IV of cat primary visual cortex (area 17) is presented to demonstrate that local intracortical excitation may provide the dominant source of orientation-selective input. In agreement with experiment, model cortical cells exhibit sharp orientation selectivity despite receiving strong iso-orientation inhibition, weak cross-orientation inhibition, no shunting inhibition, and weakly tuned thalamocortical excitation. Sharp tuning is provided by recurrent cortical excitation. As this tuning signal arises from the same pool of neurons that it excites, orientation selectivity in the model is shown to be an emergent property of the cortical feedback circuitry. In the model, as in experiment, sharpness of orientation tuning is independent of stimulus contrast and persists with silencing of ON-type subfields. The model also provides a unified account of intracellular and extracellular inhibitory blockade experiments that had previously appeared to conflict over the role of inhibition. It is suggested that intracortical inhibition acts nonspecifically and indirectly to maintain the selectivity of individual neurons by balancing strong intracortical excitation at the columnar level.},

@article{Stevens2013,
abstract = {Development of orientation maps in ferret and cat primary visual cortex (V1) has been shown to be stable, in that the earliest measurable maps are similar in form to the eventual adult map, robust, in that similar maps develop in both dark rearing and in a variety of normal visual environments, and yet adaptive, in that the final map pattern reflects the statistics of the specific visual environment. How can these three properties be reconciled? Using mechanistic models of the development of neural connectivity in V1, we show for the first time that realistic stable, robust, and adaptive map development can be achieved by including two low-level mechanisms originally motivated from single-neuron results. Specifically, contrast-gain control in the retinal ganglion cells and the lateral geniculate nucleus reduces variation in the presynaptic drive due to differences in input patterns, while homeostatic plasticity of V1 neuron excitability reduces the postsynaptic variability in firing rates. Together these two mechanisms, thought to be applicable across sensory systems in general, lead to biological maps that develop stably and robustly, yet adapt to the visual environment. The modeling results suggest that topographic map stability is a natural outcome of low-level processes of adaptation and normalization. The resulting model is more realistic, simpler, and far more robust, and is thus a good starting point for future studies of cortical map development.},
